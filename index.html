              I've been on quite an exciting journey so far! As a senior at Rutgers University, I've had the privilege of diving into the world of software engineering. Along the way, I've gained valuable experience working with an array of technologies, including Python, React, JavaScript, Node.js, Flask, Java, MongoDB, Git, and Docker. These languages and tools have allowed me to build some amazing projects and tackle various challenges.

Beyond my technical expertise, I've also fostered a deep passion for entrepreneurship. I'm proud to say that I've successfully established and grown my very own business, a cellphone repair shop. This experience has given me valuable insights into the world of business operations and customer engagement.

To complement my academic journey, I've had the incredible opportunity to complete internships at Cisco, where I further refined my skills and gained practical industry experience. These internships provided me with real-world exposure, allowing me to work on impactful projects and contribute to the success of the company.

Overall, my journey has been a remarkable one, filled with growth, learning, and a genuine love for the world of software engineering and entrepreneurship. I'm eager to continue expanding my knowledge and skills, taking on new challenges, and making a positive impact in the industry.
